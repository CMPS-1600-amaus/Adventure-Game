# CMPS 1600  Project 01

In this project, you will continue the implementation of our text-based
adventure game

To complete this lab, follow the instructions in [project-01.md](project-01.md)
([PDF version](project-01.pdf)).

## Special Instructions, Unique Features, Bonus Features

Document any necessary instructions for running your game, unique features
you implemented, or bonus features you implemented here.

...

## Submitting your work

- Put your name at the top of `Game.java`.
- Push your latest changes to GitHub

Make it as easy as possible for the graders to grade your projects. Add all
special instructions they should know above. E.g, any special instructions on
running your game. You should also detail any special decisions you made, like
replacing certain mechanics with your own. Finally, tell the graders about all
bonus opportunities that you implemented.

Do these things, and you will receive all credit that you deserve.

## Logistics and Git

This project is hosted on GitHub classrooms.

GitHub is an incredible resource in the world of software development and
computing in general. Many fundamental open-source projects ([linux], [openSSH],
[rust], [python], [tensorflow], [react], [git itself]), personal projects
([shell configurations], [disassembled pokemon red/blue]), historical projects
([DOOM], [MS-DOS], [Apollo 11]), and scientific projects ([AlphaFold], [CERN],
[NCAR], [NASA]), among others are hosted there.

We use GitHub Classrooms to create and manage your projects. We created a
project template which, when you accepted the assignment link, was copied into
a private repository for you. You will work in this private repository,
committing and pushing your work as you complete it.

### Git Workflow

When you implement a program, it is best to implement it incrementally.
Implement a small piece, compile, test. Repeat until the program is complete.

Your workflow with git should match your workflow with your code. That is, you
should use git in a small incremental fashion as well. After you complete a
small piece of your program, add, commit, and push it to GitHub. Commits are
supposed to be small. There are two major benefits to working in this way.

First, by doing so, you build a history of your project. Commits are snapshots
that you can return to. If you deleted something, or need to go back to an old
version, if you have committed it, you can do so. The smaller your commits are,
the more fine-grained control you have over returning to previous versions of
you project.

Second, every time you push to GitHub, you are pushing your latest commits to a
remote backup. If something happens to your local project, or to your computer,
you can restore your project from GitHub. This can be and has been a lifesaver
for countless developers.

Just as you compile and test your programs early and often, you should be
committing and pushing your progress as well.

### Learning Git

To learn more about git, we recommend MIT's [Missing Semester's "Version Control (Git)" Page](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/).

A great reference is the free book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
